            <h2>There’s No Such Thing as a Fairy Tale Ending</h2>
            <p>
              <em class="starring">Starring: Ava Gardner, Humphrey Bogart, Edmond O'Brien and Rossano Brazzi.</em><br />
              <strong>Summary:</strong> The barefoot contessa tells the tragic tale of Maria Vargas, a Spanish dancer who shoots to stardom after being discovered at a Spanish nightclub. With the help of straight shooter Harry Dawes (Humphrey Bogart), a writer/director and her only friend and confidant, Maria goes from poverty to Hollywood stardom, but behind the success Maria feels there’s something lacking in her life. A love she’s yearned for since her days in poverty. <br />
              The film is narrated by the few people in attendance at her funeral. Through their retellings, we see Maria involved in a few entanglements with some questionable men before finally meeting Count Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini. This should be the Cinderella ending she’s always wanted but in the words of Harry Dawes <em>“Life, every now and then, behaves as though it had seen too many bad movies.”</em><br />
              <br /><strong>My Reflection <em>(CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!)</em>:</strong> From the beginning Maria seems unreachable. Wanted by many, taken by none! The only man who is able to worm his way into her heart(in the most non-romantic way possible) is Harry and it's made quite clear to us that nothing more will come from this relationship because Harry is well and truly in love with his wife. This, of course, was necessary for the writers to clarify from the start! Had Harry been single, the two would have undoubtedly fallen in love, which would not serve the tragic ending the writers were striving for. Harry then seems to take on the role of father figure.<br />
              <br />With that complication out of the way, Maria is free to make as many mistakes as she wanted. Cue the entry of Count Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini, the dashing mysterious aristocrat to sweep our unhappy heroine away from all her misery… or so we think. His coming into Maria’s life at exactly the moment she needs rescuing seems just too good to be true. That plus the impending death of Maria looming over our heads, it’s clear something is not quite right. Favrini, like many a brooding gothic hero’s, is hiding something. The big gloomy secret is inexplicitly mentioned in a conversation between the Count and his sister as she hints at their being the last generation of their illustrious family. A vital piece of information that Favrini, the proud count that he is, doesn’t seem to think is necessary to disclose to his unsuspecting bride to be. Harry, ever the protective father figure, senses the pending car crash and sees fit to warn our love struck heroine. Of course this falls on deaf ears because that would just be too easy. Unfortunately for Maria, she discovers the truth about the Count on her wedding night and it becomes clear she will not get the Cinderella ending she’s always talked about.<br /> 
              <br />Although, the “big reveal” might have been intended to shock and make audiences sympathise with the situation Maria found herself in, I found myself chuckling at the absurdity of it all. Not only the withholding of information on Favrini’s part but Maria’s actions after the fact. Had she had any sense, she might have considered her options. An annulment comes to mind. But alas, in the world of cinema we must once again take the road with the most bumps and hazards that leads to the edge of a cliff. Maria had everything in her possession to create a great life for herself. Even after this last blow, she might have held her head high and moved on with her life because who says a woman needs a hero to be happy! Unfortunately, this was a time before it was deemed appropriate for such womanly independence so instead, she acts like a heroine from a tragic gothic novel, thus, the results are corresponding!
