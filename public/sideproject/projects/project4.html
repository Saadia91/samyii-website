              Is putting oil on  your scalp and your hair is part of<br />
              your hair care regimen?  Some people may think it’s quite<br />
              unnecessary since our scalp has glands producing sebum.<br />
              This oily secretion keeps the skin hydrated and forms a<br />
              protective layer on each strand of hair to waterproof it.<br />
              But that is the ideal scenario.<br />
              However, frequent washing and exposure to wind and dust strip<br />
              the skin and the hair of their natural coat of oil, making the<br />
              hair frizzy and the scalp dry, itchy, and flaky. The least we<br />
              can do is apply natural oils to keep them healthy. Unless you<br />
              have overly sensitive skin or some other specific<br />
              contraindication, regular oil massage can pamper your scalp and<br />
              keep your hair lustrous.
